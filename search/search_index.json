The classifier evaluates symbolic phase sequences and structural motifs to categorize artifacts into known ritual formats, including calendars, invocation sequences, astronomical registers, and others. Purpose To move beyond phase decoding alone and offer automated classification of an artifact's function based on encoded symbolic structure. This enables: Faster identification of document type (e.g., calendar, ritual script, astronomical register) Subtype differentiation (e.g., solar vs. lunar calendars) Consistent labeling of new or uncertain manuscripts Classifier Structure Architecture Input : A tokenized phase stream (e.g., ['P', 'T', 'A', 'A', 'N', ...] ) Features Extracted : Motif frequency distribution (e.g., PTAN, AATAA, etc.) Closure pattern entropy Invocation clustering density Alternation signatures (e.g., A\u2194T transitions) Total sequence length and boundary markers Model : Decision-tree backed symbolic classifier with Bayesian reinforcement Output : Predicted ritual subtype with confidence score (e.g., \"ritual calendar\" , 0.94) Subtypes Detected Subtype Key Indicators Ritual Calendar Regular closures, monthly cycles, PTAN motifs Invocation Script High invocation density, repeated A-pairings Astronomical Register Phase drift, irregular closure, planetary sync Ceremonial Path Text Linear sequence with gateway motifs (P\u2192T\u2192A\u2192N) Hybrid / Uncertain Mixed or ambiguous patterns Training and Validation Sample Data : BRES-decoded sequences from: Phaistos Disc Coligny Calendar Lead Plaque of Magliano Dresden Venus Table Synthetic Data : 200+ modeled ritual sequences for robust training Validation : Holdout cross-validation Symbolic alignment scoring Permutation tests (e.g., p < 0.01 for subtype clustering accuracy) Example Output { \"artifact\": \"Phaistos Disc\", \"classification\": \"ritual calendar\", \"confidence\": 0.91, \"features\": { \"PTAN motifs\": 5, \"closures\": 12, \"invocation density\": 0.32, \"entropy\": 0.72 } } Usage Input a BRES-decoded phase sequence into the classifier.
