The classifier evaluates symbolic phase sequences and structural motifs to categorize artifacts into known ritual formats, including calendars, invocation sequences, astronomical registers, and others. Purpose To move beyond phase decoding alone and offer automated classification of an artifact's function based on encoded symbolic structure.
