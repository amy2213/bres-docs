## Glyph-to-Phase Assignment

Assignments are based on:
- Iconographic and mythological parallels
- Phase motif clustering
- Cross-cultural ritual role alignment

### Probabilistic Assignments:
Glyphs may map to multiple phases with confidence levels (e.g., 01 â†’ A: 0.8, T: 0.2). These are used for smoother, more nuanced classification.
