# Architecture

The BRES system is built on a modular architecture designed to support symbolic ritual classification across multiple domains.

## Core Modules
- **Phase Assignment Engine**: Converts glyphs to ritual phase tokens (P, T, A, N).
- **Motif Analyzer**: Scans for repeated and statistically significant phase patterns.
- **Artifact Classifier**: Determines whether an object is a Ritual Calendar, Astronomical Register, etc.
- **Script Generator**: Builds interpretive ritual timelines or ceremonial scripts.

## Expansion Layers
- Cultural Ontology Map
- Probabilistic Phase Support
- Cross-artifact similarity scoring

Each module operates independently but integrates through a shared metadata pipeline.
