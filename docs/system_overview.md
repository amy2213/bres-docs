# Binary Ritual Encoding System (BRES) – Expanded Technical Documentation (2025)

## Overview

The Binary Ritual Encoding System (BRES) is a symbolic classification and interpretation framework for decoding ritual logic embedded in ancient, non-linguistic artifacts such as the Phaistos Disc and the Dresden Codex. BRES identifies modular glyph sequences using a four-phase grammar—Passive, Transitional, Active, Neutral (P, T, A, N)—and classifies them as one of several ritual types. It now includes subtype analysis and a full interpretive ritual generation pipeline.
